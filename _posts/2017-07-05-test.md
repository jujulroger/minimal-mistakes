Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.


<div id="example"></div>

<script src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/js/test-d3.js"></script>

blablabla
